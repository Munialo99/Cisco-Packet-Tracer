# Interdepartmental Network Integration: Enhancing Organizational Connectivity using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Task
Create a network in CISCO Packet Tracer to connect the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY
departments as follows:
a. Ensure each department includes at least 2 PCs.
b. Use an appropriate number of switches and routers for the network.
c. Configure all interfaces with suitable IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways using the provided network address 192.168.40.0.
d. Connect all devices in the network using the appropriate cables.
e. Verify the connectivity between the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments - PCs in the DELIVERY department should be able to ping PCs in the ACCOUNTS department.
